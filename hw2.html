<h2>Homework 2 Assignment</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER TWO</h3>
<p>In chapter two, two topics that stood out to me were The Evils of Duplication, Orthogonality, and Tracer Bullets. 
The Evils of Duplication and Orthogonality go hand in hand as the first section states not to duplicate information throughout 
your code and the second tells you not to split the information across multiple system components. 
</p>

<p>There are four different sections in The Evils of Duplication, imposed duplication, inadvertent duplication, impatient duplication, 
    and interdeveloper duplication. Each adds to the instability of duplicating code which causes extra time in maintenance. 
    Imposed duplication is where the developer feels as if the code requires duplication. This is because we often have the same information 
    represented in different forms throughout the code. The DRY principle comes into play where the developer should keep the information only 
    in the code, not the comments. Inadvertent duplication is where the developer doesn’t realize they are duplicating the information. 
    This is because of mistakes in the design of the code. This issue is a reminder to always use accessor functions to read and write the 
    attributes of objects in object-oriented languages. Impatient duplication is completely on the developer’s laziness and interdeveloper 
    duplication is due to multiple developers not communicating effectively.
</p>

<p>
    Orthogonality is critical for code that easy to design, build, test. If two methods are orthogonal, they are independent of each other 
    and a change in one does not affect the other. On the other hand, nonorthogonal systems are more complex to change and can cause more 
    problems down the line. Orthogonal systems have an increase in productivity and an overall reduced risk. The developer gains productivity 
    because the orthogonal approach promotes the reuse of old code. There is no need to change existing code when adding new code. This causes 
    less testing time, and the system is easier to reconfigure. A good thing to keep in mind is that if the object you are manipulating requires 
    to create or access objects in a special way, then it’s not orthogonal.
